\section{Conclusion}

The ground station software used to monitor, record and display real-time telemetry data from the CUInSpace rocket is a
complex system composing of a frontend user interface and a backend communication parsing and distributing system.

In conjunction, the two are used to display real-time rocket telemetry data to members on mission control. They allow
mission control to monitor the rocket's flight, anticipate issues and communicate which data they would like to prioritize from 
the rocket transmitter. They also allow real-time playback of past missions for training and analysis purposes.
