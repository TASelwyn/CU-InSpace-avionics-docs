\subsection{User Interface}

 The dashboard visualizes data on different charts using Apache ECharts. Temperature, pressure, velocity and altitude are displayed among other indicators. Flight time is tracked using the mission timer component.

The UI fundamentally makes use of a websocket connection to the Python backend, which sends telemetry data in real-time as it receives it from the rocket transmission chip. This data is sent in JSON format, where it is unpacked and displayed in chart components.
