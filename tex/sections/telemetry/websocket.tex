\subsection{WebSocket}

The WebSocket is created using the Tornado Web library in Python on localhost:33845/websocket.\\
The socket can be connected to using the standard http to websocket upgrade scheme.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
There is no implemented authentication, therefore all connections have full permissions.\\

\subsubsection{Output}
The output comes from the telemetry process in our websocket output format \cite{websocket_format}. This is passed to all connected websocket clients with absolutely no conversion.
