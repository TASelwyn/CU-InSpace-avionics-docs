\subsection{WebSocket}

The WebSocket is created using the Tornado Web library in Python on localhost:33845/websocket using the standard http to websocket upgrade scheme.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
Currently, any locally connected client is automatically authenticated with full permissions.

\subsubsection{Output}
The output comes from the telemetry process in our unique websocket output json format \cite{websocket_format}. This is passed to all connected websocket clients with absolutely no conversion.
