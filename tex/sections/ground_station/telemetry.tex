\subsection{Telemetry}

\subsubsection{Parsing Packets}
The telemetry packets are received in a custom encoded scheme in accordance with our Radio Packet Format \cite{radio_packet_format}.

\subsubsection{Output}
After telemetry packets are parsed, the latest copy of each are stored in the process in order to create a JSON message. This message is created in accordance with our WebSocket Format \cite{websocket_format}. This ensures easily cross platform operability as JSON is a widely used format for data transfer.

\subsubsection{Replay}
Missions can be recorded and played back at a later date. This recording is controlled using the user interface, where the telemetry server will record all packets to a mission file. After a mission is recorded, it shows up under mission list on the user interface where the user can specify which one they'd like to play back.

\subsubsection{Logging}
